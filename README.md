## CS 8674 - Master Project

This repository consists of the source code for the Master Project. All the notebooks were run on Google Colab using A100 GPU. As the running times were considerably higher, we recommed the graders to also do the same for ease of use. All the additional dependencies were mentioned in the notebook files.

For this project, we needed to create the multimodal synthetic dataset. The UnifiedModal_DatasetCreation.ipynb file consists of all the necessary code files we used to create our dataset. For some reason, this file is not properly rendering on the Github but it works fine after downloading it.

The UnifiedModal_Unimodal_Classifers.ipynb file consists of all the code needed to run and benchmark the unimodal classifiers as reported in the project report.

The UnifiedModal_Multimodal_Classifiers.pynb file consists of all the code needed to run and benchmark the multimodal classifiers as reported in the project report.
